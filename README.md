# PNGtoPDF
#### Python command line PNG to PDF converter

### When the .png image is in the same directory as the script is run from you can just write the filename.png as the first argument after pngToPDF.py

### The same goes for the savepath, when you want to save the .pdf file in the same directory as the script gets run from you can just give the output-filename as the second argument after pngToPDF.py

### If you renamed the file from pngToPDF.py to something else .py then replace pngToPDF.py to the new filename and be sure to run the command from the same directory as the file lays in or to give the absolute path to the file like (in home folder) ~/absolute/path/to/file.py or (from drive root) /absolute/path/to/file.py

## 1. Usually first:
##  Terminal/CMD: cd /directory/of/converter/file.py

## 2.

## macOS and Linux:
##  Terminal: python3 pngToPDF.py /path/to/png/image.png /path/to/save.pdf

### or

## Windows:
##  CMD: python pngToPDF.py /path/to/png/image.png /path/to/save.pdf
